# Description
This a simple sorting visualiser for sorting algorithms that currently include merge sort, insertion sort, quick sort and bubble sort. 
I will add more as I get time. The project is made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. I used Promises to implement the functionality of the Stop and Continue 
buttons and also a sleep function that slows the sorting algorithm so you can see how it works. I have added the colors to make the visualization better.

# Steps to use:
1. Select the sorting algorithm, set the size of array using the slider and click on sort.
2. You can speed up from 1.0x to 1.5x .. upto 4.0x and slow down upto 0.5x.
3. You can stop the algorithm in between using Stop and resume using Continue.
